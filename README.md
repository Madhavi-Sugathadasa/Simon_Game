## A model of Simon Game

---
This is how the Simon game works.

Firstly, the game shows the first colour in the sequence (let say blue). The user clicks on the blue button.
Next, the game shows the next colour (let say red), the user has to remember the sequence is blue, red and so on and so forth.
If the user messes up the sequence, then the game ends.
